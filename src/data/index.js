<p>What I have observed till now in the Empowerers eBay Facebook group, the biggest issue of existing eBay sellers is “new account MC 113 suspension”! It happens because users are unaware of the steps eBay account for, and the seller account gets suspended. Out of every 10 posts, 1 is of new eBay account suspension. Please take care of your HIGHLY SCALEABLE GLOBAL SHOP, EBAY, and read and comprehend all the following.</p>

<p>Remember, eBay earns when you sell. eBay does not enjoy your account suspensions but in actual it faces loss when it suspends your account. It does this just to keep the eBay community safe from scammers.</p>

<p>For the last 6 years being an eCommerce seller, for approx. last 2 years being the seller on eBay and for the last 8 months being the founder of the Empowerers, an “eBay focused” organization, and “the Leaders of eBay training in Pakistan”, I have tried my best to cover all the possible steps which may save you from the suspension of the new eBay seller account. Empowerers will keep empowering you so you can dominate the eBay global market. For eBay freelancers, eBay consultants, and eBay VAs, if you follow all the following steps, you can charge a better fee from your International clients of Upwork, Guru, Fiverr, people per hour, toptal etc.</p>

      "Amazon seller account from Pakistan, eBay is still easy, amazon is still hard",
    date: "Jan 14, 2021",

    description: `<p>Pakistan in the seller list of Amazon is a huge success of the people who were striving for this, this is an achievement for Pakistan too. And, we as Pakistanis are happy for this achievement. Amazon is a giant and the biggest marketplace in the world.</p>

<p>For Pakistan being in the seller list of Amazon, you still cannot sell on amazon.com from amazon.co.uk, you will have to register separately for the other domains. Unlike Amazon, on eBay, you can use a single login credential to sell on any of the international eBay markets, be it UK, AUS, Germany, USA, or any other from its 23 international websites (marketplaces). This is one of the most luxurious and royal kinds of features of eBay.</p>

<p>If you can subscribe to an Amazon seller account from Pakistan, you still have to pay for the clicks people do on your ad on Amazon, no matter if they buy your product or not (PPC). On eBay, you pay eBay for your ad only if it is sold.</p>

<p>On Amazon, you still have to make huge investments (compared to eBay) to develop your business, no matter if you can subscribe to the seller account from Pakistan or not.</p>

<p>Amazon will still compete with your good-selling products, your PLs, and your wholesale sales. eBay will not.</p>

<p>The ranking and selling strategies are still the same on Amazon, which eat up a huge chunk of your investment while building your business on Amazon.</p>

<p>The learning curve for Amazon is still bigger than eBay, no matter if Pakistan is on the seller list or not.</p>

<p>Please be clear, Empowerers supports selling on Amazon, also has its PL, wholesale, Kindle, and affiliate business on it, but the point here is: what suits you? If you have big investments, go for Amazon along with eBay, and if you have less investment, building a business on eBay will be good for you. If you plan to invest all of your Amazon investment in eBay (with proper preparation), there are high chances that you will enjoy better benefits than Amazon.</p>

<p>eBay is an easy entry point for you into the eCommerce world, it gives you easy success and boosts your confidence. Use this confidence to further increase your eBay business, and then go and explore any of the marketplaces.</p>

<p>Yes, you can provide Amazon freelancing services and earn well, and the secret is, there is an almost equal number of online freelancing contracts for eBay as for Amazon. The eBay marketplace has far less competition, and if you can provide quality services, you have a big business in your hand. You can better judge the current number of Amazon service providers and eBay service providers in Pakistan.</p>

<p>You know yourself better. Choose wisely!</p>

`<ol class="list-decimal">
  <li>eBay is your step one to the eCommerce world due to its friendly nature for sellers.</li>
  <li>eBay is easier to learn than any other eCommerce marketplace.</li>
  <li>It does not charge you on a monthly basis just for the reason that you want to sell online.</li>
  <li>It does not compete with your successful listings as “fulfilled and sold by Amazon.”</li>
  <li>Normally, you start getting sales right from the start, even if your account is new. There is no financial bleeding needed. Just learn, practice, and experience eBay. Grip eBay.</li>
  <li>Unlike Amazon PPC, which charges you on each click, eBay charges you only when you have a sale.</li>
  <li>Unlike Amazon, your one eBay account allows you to sell worldwide, meaning eBay.co.uk sellers can sell on the eBay.com marketplace too with the same login credentials. This makes eBay one of the most flexible and scalable marketplaces.</li>
  <li>You can sell your product in many ways:
    <ol class="list-decimal">
      <li>Through auction listings</li>
      <li>Through "Buy It Now" listings</li>
      <li>By accepting offers and sending counteroffers</li>
      <li>By sending special discounts to interested buyers (Watchers)</li>
      <li>And many more methods</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>You can do eBay PL, eBay wholesale, and eBay dropshipping.</li>
  <li>If your account’s health is fine, eBay is the easiest marketplace to do dropshipping.</li>
  <li>As a seller, you receive your payment instantly right after you sell the product—no need to wait for 14 days.</li>
  <li>Your account registration process is very simple, just like signing up for a Gmail account. However, Empowerers suggest some precautions to reduce the chances of eBay account suspension.</li>
  <li>There is no proof of identity or proof of address required at the start. No need to provide documents or go through a lengthy registration or tax interview process.</li>
  <li>Since you can make your first sale in a short period without any investment (if you are a student of Empowerers), this boosts your confidence in eBay and eCommerce.</li>
  <li>If you invest in eBay PL following Empowerers' training, find and get approval for the right product, you can achieve at least a 100% or more ROI.</li>
  <li>The chances of success for your eBay PL are high because not only do you sell your PL product on eBay, but other EBC and EBC executive (1-on-1) students also sell the same products on their accounts. This increases the chances of your eBay PL success.</li>
  <li>If you do not have the investment to start your own eBay PL, you can still sell the products of other EBC executive (1-on-1) students and the products of Empowerers on your account. Along with these product sales, you can also do Amazon-to-eBay and AliExpress-to-eBay sales (OA sales), increasing your chances of financial success on eBay.</li>
  <li>During your eBay PL, you get complete guidance on:
    <ol class="list-decimal">
      <li>Product approval process</li>
      <li>Analysis sheet development</li>
      <li>Sourcing guidance</li>
      <li>Direct sourcing assistance</li>
      <li>Final analysis sheets</li>
      <li>International shipping management</li>
      <li>Domestic shipping (within target country) calculations</li>
      <li>Fulfillment center recommendations from Empowerers</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>You benefit from Empowerers' partner fulfillment centers in Houston, USA, and Glasgow, UK. This eliminates the need for fulfillment services from eBay (such as Amazon FBA).</li>
  <li>At Empowerers, you find a comprehensive network of:
    <ol class="list-decimal">
      <li>eBay coaches</li>
      <li>eBay sellers</li>
      <li>eBay consultants (EBC and EBC Executive students)</li>
      <li>eBay VAs (SVR students)</li>
      <li>eBay investors (EBC executive students who also participate in investments)</li>
      <li>eBay account owners (normally overseas Pakistani individuals with accounts in hand, interested in eBay partnerships)</li>
      <li>eBay potential products from manufacturers already available in the USA and UK target markets</li>
      <li>eBay potential products from Amazon PL sellers who also wish to sell on eBay</li>
      <li>eBay store template and other technical service providers</li>
      <li>eBay dropshipping product providers, including item-by-item shipping services on your behalf</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The “eBay Business Central Management Software” developed by Empowerers makes your eBay business journey extremely easy. You can manage most of your eBay business functions within this software and track your financial success through it. Alhamdulillah, with Empowerers, you now have a comprehensive eBay ecosystem.</li>
